# genalyzer: Library of DSP functions for RF measurements

Genalyzer is a C++ library that facilitates the computation of commonly used data-converter RF performance metrics in a standards-complaint manner. Genalyzer supports generation of waveforms for characterizing data-converters as well as the computation of performance metrics given the time- or frequency-domain response of data-converters to such waveforms. In other words, users not only have the option of selecting whether or not to opt for waveform generation to characterize data-convereters, but are also able to utilize time-series data or FFT of samples captured from a data-convereter to directly compute the desired performance metrics.
